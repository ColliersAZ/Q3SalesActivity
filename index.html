<p>Investment activity in Phoenix slowed by 20% quarter-over-quarter in Q3, yet remained at its strongest level since Q2 2022. Three of the five major asset classes—office, industrial, and retail—registered year-over-year sales volume gains. The office sector led with a 151% annual increase, followed by a 25.5% rise in industrial volume. Notably, Phoenix has posted positive year-over-year quarterly sales growth every quarter since Q2 2024, underscoring a period of renewed market stability and sustained investor confidence.</p>

    <p>Nationally, Phoenix ranked 9th in total investment sales volume in Q3, supported by strong sector performance, including the 5th-highest industrial sales volume and the 6th-highest office sales volume across U.S. markets.</p>

    <p>The Phoenix office sector continues to stand out in 2025, posting the strongest year-over-year sales volume increase among all asset types, up 151%. This mirrors the national trend, where office led all sectors in annual gains. Over the past five years, office investment activity peaked in Q1 2021 at a time when low interest rates, abundant capital, and expectations of an office recovery fueled elevated transaction volume. Investors were actively positioning for a return-to-office rebound, driving competitive bidding for well-located assets. In Q3 of this year, Phoenix’s office sector reached its highest national ranking within that five-year period, placing 6th with $597 million in total sales volume.</p>

    <p>Pricing has adjusted accordingly, with the average price per square foot declining 9.5% year-over-year. Private buyers have driven the majority of transactions, accounting for 76.9% of year-to-date office acquisitions—the highest share in a decade, aside from an 83.1% peak in 2023. Meanwhile, cross-border investors have transitioned from being net buyers between 2015 and 2021 to net sellers beginning in 2023, signaling reduced foreign capital deployment and a greater reliance on domestic capital to sustain market activity.</p>

    <p>Phoenix’s industrial market continues to demonstrate exceptional momentum, both in development and investment activity. Over the past five years, Phoenix has consistently ranked among the top U.S. industrial markets by sales volume. This year, the market placed 4th nationally in Q2 with $975 million in trades and 5th in Q3 with $1.36 billion, behind only Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Pricing has strengthened accordingly, with the average price per square foot rising 15.6% year-over-year—the fourth consecutive quarter of annual price growth.</p>

    <p>Unlike the office sector, Phoenix industrial has continued to attract global capital. Cross-border investors have posted positive net acquisitions every year since 2021, reflecting sustained international confidence in the market’s distribution, logistics, and manufacturing fundamentals. While institutional buyers dominated during 2019–2020, private buyers have significantly increased their presence in recent years, narrowing the gap and playing a more active role in acquisition activity.</p>

    <div class="sector-title">Multifamily</div>
    <iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26060440/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'></iframe><div style='width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;'><a class='flourish-credit' href='https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26060440/?utm_source=embed&utm_campaign=visualisation/26060440' target='_top' style='text-decoration:none!important'><img alt='Made with Flourish' src='https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg' style='width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;'> </a></div>
    <p>Apartment sales volume in Phoenix has consistently ranked among the strongest nationally, placing within the top ten in most quarters since 2019. Activity accelerated in 2021 when the U.S. multifamily market peaked amid low interest rates, strong capital inflows, and significant in-migration to Sun Belt metros, lifting Phoenix into the top five through 2022. Momentum moderated in late 2023 and early 2024 as higher borrowing costs and pricing uncertainty slowed transactions, pushing Phoenix below the top ten. However, the market regained traction, and in Q3 2025 Phoenix returned to tenth place with $1.45 billion in sales volume. This total is 4.9% below a year earlier, with average price per unit down 3.5%, though demand remains resilient. Even with elevated new supply, long-term fundamentals remain solid, and occupancy has improved quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, indicating new units are being successfully absorbed.</p>

    <div class="sector-title">Retail</div>
    <iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26060480/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'></iframe><div style='width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;'><a class='flourish-credit' href='https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26060480/?utm_source=embed&utm_campaign=visualisation/26060480' target='_top' style='text-decoration:none!important'><img alt='Made with Flourish' src='https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg' style='width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;'> </a></div>
    <p>Retail sales volume in Phoenix ranked tenth nationally in Q3, compared to fourth place in the previous quarter. Sales volume increased 16.6% year-over-year, though it declined 56.3% quarter-over-quarter following an unusually strong Q2. Average price per square foot rose 51.7% from a year ago, reflecting the premium being placed on well-located retail assets. Cross-border net acquisitions have remained negative since 2020, indicating that recent activity has been driven primarily by domestic investors.</p>

    <div class="sector-title">Hospitality</div>
    <iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26060528/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'></iframe><div style='width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;'><a class='flourish-credit' href='https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26060528/?utm_source=embed&utm_campaign=visualisation/26060528' target='_top' style='text-decoration:none!important'><img alt='Made with Flourish' src='https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg' style='width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;'> </a></div>
    <p>Hospitality in Phoenix, on the other hand, has shown notable volatility in national rankings. In Q2, Phoenix led the nation in hotel sales volume at $969.2 million, but in Q3 activity fell sharply—down 94.7% to just $51 million, placing the market outside the top ten. A similar pattern occurred last year, with strong sales in the second quarter followed by a more than 90% decline in the third. This seasonal swing aligns with Phoenix’s winter and spring high-season performance cycle, when underwriting conditions are strongest and large hotel transactions typically close. Average price per square foot also declined 8.4% year-over-year.</p>
